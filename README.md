There are 4 types of users: unregistered user, registered user, collaborator, administrator.

The collaborator user can add products to the store. They will send requests for addition to the administrator, who can approve or reject them. After approval, the products will be visible in the store.

Products are part of categories. Categories are dynamically created by the administrator. The admin can add new categories directly from the application interface. Also, the admin is the one who can view, edit, and delete categories as needed.

A product has a title, description, image, price, rating (1-5 stars), and user reviews.

The collaborator user can also edit and delete products they have added.

The unregistered user will be redirected to create an account when trying to add a product to the cart. When not logged in, they can only view products and associated comments.

When a user becomes a registered user, they can place orders (add products to the cart) and leave reviews, which they can later edit or delete.

Products can be searched by name through a search engine. Additionally, products should be found even if a user searches for specific parts of the name.

Search engine results can be sorted in ascending or descending order by price and number of stars.

The administrator can delete and edit both products and comments. They can also activate or revoke user rights.
